     <h2>Setting Up Bait Fishing</h2>
     <p>In order to set up bait fishing you will need a couple of things.</p>
     <ul>All of the following items should probably not be rated above ten pounds. Beginners should start small, and as such catch smaller fish. You will probably find pre-built rods in the store, but the list will feature everything just in case.
      <li>A Spinning Rod and Reel</li>
      <li>A line for the reel</li>
      <li>Hooks and Baits. Worms and small minnows are my personal favorites.</li>
     </ul>
