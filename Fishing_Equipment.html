     <h2>Rods</h2>
     <p>There several different types of rods, some that are extrememly specialized, and some that can be used for just about anything. I will cover the main difference between any two rods. That is whether or not it is a spinning rod, or a casting rod.</p>
     <h3>Spinning Rods</h3>
     <p>Spinning Rods are rods whose reel must be a spinning reel. This causes a cascade of differences, but the important thing to note is that spinning reels are easier to use for beginners, but have a harder time catching heavier fish. The majority of fisherman that are fishing using baits will use a spinning rod. You must make sure that you buy a reel that matches the rod. I recommend going in person to buy your gear so that you can ask for help from someone you trust that knows how to fish, or you can ask the employees for help as, assuming its a dedicated store for fishing gear, they probably have a general idea what you should look for.</p>
