     <h2>Introduction</h2>
     <p>Hello, my name is Devin Wooddell and the purpose of this website is to try and teach my peers how to get started with fishing.</p> 
     <p> First, there are a couple of things that need to be done prior to fishing.</p>
     <ul>You will need to get:
      <li>A Fishing License (and knowledge of local and federal laws)</li>
      <li>A Good Spot to fish</li>
      <li>(optional) A kayak/canoe/boat etc.</li>
     </ul>
     <p>Another thing that needs to be done prior to fishing is, surprise surprise, getting your fishing equipment. What equipment you buy, however, is based of what type of fishing you want to do. The two types are lure and bait fishing. Lure fishing is more active, you put on one of the many types of lures and move it around in the water to attract fish. Bait fishing on the other hand, is more relaxed while waiting for a fish to bite the bait you have floating in the water. If you aren't sure, feel free to flip a coin, but I will say that bait fishing is typically easier for beginners, while lure fishing has greater potential for catching lots of fish. Also, you could always try both ways of fishing ;)</p>
     <p>BUT WAIT! Before we get into what type of fishing you want to do, we first need to take a detour and learn about the equipment itself. You see, the equipment varies greatly between the types of fishing, so you need to know what is you're even looking for before you go and look for it. With that being said click <a href="Fishing_Equipment.html">here</a> to read about what I have to say in regards to the varied equipment.
     <p>Ok, now that we've got that out of the way... CHOOSE</p>
